=== Contract Template Questions: ===

*) I replaced with a placeholder

  {{ContractDuration}}

*) I'm going to change following text to placeholders:

  ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX THOUSAND PESOS (PHP146,000.00)
   
   - to {{SomeName}}

  inclusive

    - to {{InventoryList}}

  July 15, 2020 to September 14, 2020.

  - Can I replace it to {{LeaseStart}} to {{LeaseEnd}}

1) PropertyNo - Unit 
   PropertyName - Building/Village
   PropertySection - Tower/Street
   
   PropertyAddress & PropertyStreet are empty always.

2) A.Condo and B.House I remove anyway and I remove 1 paragraph 
   based on PropertyType

3) Inclusive - Inventory List (TRUE for Inclusive && FALSE for exclusive)

4) {{LeaseStart}} and {{LeaseEnd}} are formatted like:

    January 20, 2020

5) LeaseRate - Gross sales rate

6) Parking Slot No - Why is it formatted like PHP

7) ADVANCE PAYMENT / SECURITY DEPOSIT. Should I keep both or only one?
   Autocalculate Deposit*LeaseRate

8) REMAINING RENTAL PAYMENT: 
   
   (Option A) && (Option B). Which one should I select. 

   How to calculate value in this table.


Building/Village doesn't appear
TAble 
Rental period 2 spaces.
